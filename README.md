# Basic NLP using NLTK and scikit-learn


## What you built? 

A "TextAnalyzer" class that is able to take a csv file of text message information and perform some basic analyses:

* Words commonly used by senders from specific countries (term-frequency analysis)
* "Important" words commonly used by senders from specific countries (term-frequency inverse-document-frequency analysis) 
* Prediction of sender's country of origin based on message (using Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier) 

Below are example outputs for each (which can also be obtained by running the tests.py file): 

* [Term-frequency analysis](./example1)  
* [TF-IDF analysis](./example2.jpeg)
* [MNB classifier prediction](./example3.jpeg)
